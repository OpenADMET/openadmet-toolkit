`openadmet-toolkit` contains helpful toolkit functionality for the large scale ADMET modelling conducted as part of the [OpenADMET project](https://openadmet.org).
Much of the functionality is focused around data scraping, cleaning, screening and preparation for downstream machine learning workflows. Additional one-off workflows related to functionality used directly by the OpenADMET team are also contained in this repo. You can see a demonstration of some toolkit functionality in our [Example Tutorials](https://demos.openadmet.org) and [Binder demo](https://try.openadmet.org). More developed functionality for machine learning is contained in the `OpenADMET Models` [repo](https://github.com/OpenADMET/openadmet-models/tree/main).
